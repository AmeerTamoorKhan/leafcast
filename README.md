## 🎬 About The Project

**LeafCast GAN Deck** is a fully interactive HTML/CSS/JS presentation that visually explains **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** through a storytelling metaphor:

> 🦹 A Counterfeiter (Generator)  
> 👮 A Police Detective (Discriminator)  
> ⚖️ Locked in a battle until equilibrium is reached.

This project transforms complex deep learning theory into an intuitive, animated, fullscreen-ready presentation experience.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This project was built with:

- Clean 1280×720 fixed slide canvas
- Template-based slide shell
- Minimal external dependencies
- Smooth CSS transitions
- Focus & iframe isolation for fullscreen stability

The goal:  
> Make deep learning intuitive without sacrificing technical depth.

## 📚 Educational Impact

GANs are often explained mathematically.  
This presentation makes them:

✔ Visual  
✔ Interactive  
✔ Memorable  
✔ Story-driven  

Bridging theory and intuition.
