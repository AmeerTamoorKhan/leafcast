# 🌿🎭 LeafCast — Generative Adversarial Networks Explained

### *An Interactive Visual Storytelling Experience for Understanding GANs*

</div>

---

## 🎬 About The Project

**LeafCast GAN Deck** is a fully interactive HTML/CSS/JS presentation that visually explains **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** through a storytelling metaphor:

> 🦹 A Counterfeiter (Generator)  
> 👮 A Police Detective (Discriminator)  
> ⚖️ Locked in a battle until equilibrium is reached.

This project transforms complex deep learning theory into an intuitive, animated, fullscreen-ready presentation experience.
